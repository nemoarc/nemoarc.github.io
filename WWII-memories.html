<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">Have you ever
wondered how the 18% of GI&rsquo;s in Europe during World War II handled
the ordinary things that you take for granted?  Things such as
sleeping, eating, bathing, brushing your teeth, changing your
clothes, and bathroom necessities.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">During World War II
in Europe only 18% of the troops were under sustained enemy fire and
a total of 21% were in hazardous areas.  Having been a 18 percenter
during the European campaign, I can tell you it isn&rsquo;t like the
Rambo movies.  It is hours and days of mind-numbing waiting, much
heavy work, miserable conditions and continual fear.  You become
emotionally detached, desensitized to your conditions, and
fatalistically accept the inevitable death.  </font>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">My experiences under
fire started in late November of 1944 and lasted until May of 1945. 
I was with the 10</font><sup><font size="4">th</font></sup><font size="4">
Armored Infantry Battalion and the 55</font><sup><font size="4">th</font></sup><font size="4">
Armored Infantry Battalion of the 4</font><sup><font size="4">th</font></sup><font size="4">
Armored Division and the 11</font><sup><font size="4">th</font></sup><font size="4">
Armored Division.  Both divisions were part of the Third Army under
the command of General George Patton.  I was a light machine gunner. 
This is not a very desirable job, but I was very lucky and was always
in the right place at the right time. </font>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">My first thought
while stationed in England was a curiosity of what actual combat
would be like.  In September of 1944 we all thought that the war was
nearly over.  Little did we know.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">When you first come
under enemy fire, the fear of dying hits you like a fast railroad
train.  As time progresses this fear changes to deep depression and
resignation.  You know that you are going to get wounded.  It is just
a matter of how bad and when.  When the fear of dying leaves you,
then a new fear usually takes over.  The fear of a serious,
crippling, painful injury becomes your concern.  We had several men
who would put their arms out of their foxhole to try to get &ldquo;a
million dollar wound&rdquo;.  This was a wound that would get you out of
combat but not so serious as to be crippling.  </font>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">We had some men reach
their breaking point and shoot themselves just severely enough to
have &ldquo;a million dollar wound&rdquo;.  Some soldiers would take off
their shoes and put their bare feet up against the side of the tank
to quickly freeze them.  We didn&rsquo;t have ill feelings against these
people because most of us had the same thoughts.  Eventually you
become emotionally detached and resigned to your fate.  All of us
were worn down by the sheer stress of continually waiting for what
you know is coming- the pains of severe injury or death.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">Whenever additional
soldiers were sent as replacements, we wouldn&rsquo;t try to get very
close to them because we knew they probably wouldn&rsquo;t be around
long.  Most new men had nicknames and that was the extent of our
intimate knowledge of them.  Generally if you lasted past the first
battle, you would survive for quite a while.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">I believe that I owe
my life to a scoutmaster whom I knew as a boy.  This scoutmaster had
us scouts spend considerable time camping under all sorts of
conditions- even in the winter.  Then when the Belgium winter hit I
was better prepared for the cold than many of the soldiers in our
outfit.  This scoutmaster also had us play a game called &ldquo;Capture
the Flag&rdquo; whenever he couldn&rsquo;t think of anything for us to do. 
This game prepared me for night patrols similar to going behind enemy
lines only it was much safer.  My hunting experience as a boy also
helped me survive.  Some conditions we encountered were difficult.  </font>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">Take sleep for
instance.  Most of our sleeping occurred while sitting up in a
foxhole.  Sometimes we had a blanket but much of the time we didn&rsquo;t.
 My assistant gunner and I would dig a foxhole through the frozen
earth and we would huddle together under a blanket if we were lucky
to have one.  If we were really lucky, we might have what we called a
mummy sack.  It was a sleeping bag.  We would take turns sitting on
the other&rsquo;s feet to keep them warm, but not long enough to let your
feet get numb. The winter was bitter cold- the coldest in Belgium&rsquo;s
history up to that date.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">At night we would
take one pair of socks off our feet and put them on our back next to
our skin.  The pair of socks on our back was moved to our stomach,
and the pair of stockings from our stomach was put on our feet.  This
ritual was done to dry out the stockings and prevent both frostbite
and later in the spring, trench foot.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">Early in the winter
several of us discarded our combat boots which were nine-inch leather
boots.  We put on several pairs of stockings, cut strips of our
woolen blankets and wrapped them around our feet, and then put on our
overshoes.  This caused difficulty in walking but did prevent our
feet from freezing.  We did have problems when we had a long march
and our feet would sweat.  Then when we stopped for the night, our
feet would get quite cold.  Often the woolen overcoat we wore would
be very stiff with ice in the morning because it would have gotten
wet the day before and then froze at night.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">Whenever we were
lucky to get near our halftracks, we could usually get dry stockings
and more blankets that the driver had scrounged up for us.  We really
looked forward to getting the blankets and stockings.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">There is a misnomer
in the label &ldquo;Armored Infantry.&rdquo;  The only difference between us
and the regular infantry was that we traveled in an assigned
halftrack rather than any available truck.  A halftrack is a vehicle
that has wheels on the front and tracks on the back and can go over
much rougher terrain than a  truck.  The only armor on them is a thin
plate that will deflect some small arms fire.  Usually when we got
near to the front lines we would get out of the halftracks and either
walk or get on the back of a Sherman tank.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">Whenever we drew any
kind of enemy fire, we would have to get out in front of the tanks to
protect them from infantry men with panzerfauces.  These are small
throwaway tank-killing rockets.  They were like our Bazookas but were
disposable.  Tanks are extremely vulnerable in towns or woods because
their visibility is limited, and a single man with a Bazooka can
disable a tank.  In one small Belgium town a GI dropped a five-gallon
GI gas can on the top of a Panther German tank.  He dropped the gas
can from the upstairs window of a house.  Another GI shot the can and
set fire to the tank.  That is the reason for putting men out in
front of the tanks.  We were not very fond of walking near a tank for
two reasons.  First, they drew artillery fire and second, they were
heavy enough to set off land mines near us.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">There isn&rsquo;t a good
time of the year for war.  Winter is cold, spring is wet, and in
summer and fall the trees have lots of foliage on them and seeing the
enemy is difficult.  Frostbite and frozen feet were serious problems
in our outfit.  Just think of yourself as homeless and out in a
strange country in the winter and not able to make a fire.  That is
the kind of weather in which the Battle of the Bulge was fought
during the winter of 1944.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">Another difficulty
was that usually one-half of us were supposed to be awake and
watching.  It was hour after hour of endless watching and nothing
happening.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">European warfare
wasn&rsquo;t non-stop fighting like the movies.  It was endless waiting
and ducking artillery or mortar fire.  The vast majority of
casualties are not from small arms fire but from artillery, mortar,
mines, booby traps and bombs.  Shrapnel (shrapnel is the metal
fragment of the casing of a grenade, artillery shell, mine, or other
explosives) caused most of our wounds, not bullets.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">The most heroic thing
that I saw was a Medic (our first-aide man) treat a soldier who had
stepped on a shoe mine.  These mines had been designed to blow a foot
off.  We were walking single file in the snow to keep the odds down
of everyone hitting a mine.  This medic made a fresh path in the snow
where no one had walked, knowing that he would probably hit a mine. 
Fortunately, he didn&rsquo;t.  Then there were offset-castrating mines. 
We had three men injured by these mines that set off a small charge
between your legs when you stepped on them.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">Once we were pinned
down in a snow storm somewhere in Belgium by a German tank.  The tank
had run low on fuel and was being used as a stationary fortification.
 We couldn&rsquo;t move because when we shook the snow off our overcoats
we then became a visible target for their turret machine guns.  I
started shaking from both cold and fright and couldn&rsquo;t control the
shaking.  My body was shaking so badly that I was afraid that the
snow would shake off me and I would become a target.  However the
snow didn&rsquo;t fall off me and we lay there till darkness came, then
crawled back up the hill.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">As for bathing and
showers, you don&rsquo;t get any on the front lines.  We went seventy-
two days without a shower.  It was humorous in that we all walked in
the temporary shower tent looking like huge guards on a football
team.  Then after taking off all of the layers of clothing we were
wearing, we then were very thin.  You could count all the bones in
our bodies.  We wore several layers of clothing to keep warm.  It
wasn&rsquo;t uncommon to be wearing three pairs of long underwear and
three pairs of pants to keep warm.  </font>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">As far as brushing
your teeth, you didn&rsquo;t.  We ate K-rations mostly.  These meals were
in a box the size of a crackerjack box and they contained one meal. 
As I remember the K-rations included a small can of food about the
size of a small tuna can.  It had either scrambled powdered eggs, a
meat loaf type of food or a cheese meal.  The rations also had a
small packet of toilet paper, a packet of cigarettes, a high-energy
tasteless candy bar, and a powdered drink.  The powdered drink was
either lemonade, coffee, or bouillon soup.  We also had C-rations
that were two small cans comprising a complete meal similar to the
K-rations.  After we went into Germany we would confiscate
blueberries from the farm houses that we came to.  This we considered
a delicacy.  </font>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">We weren&rsquo;t very
sanitary in how we ate or how we existed.  Our helmets were two
units, one a plastic liner for normal use, and a steel outside unit
for combat.  Near the Siegfried fortifications in Germany I had to
use the steel liner as a toilet because if I got out of the hole, I
was dead. I rinsed out the liner with water from a canteen then put
the two helmets together and put them back on my head.  Then several
days later at a resupply area I used the steel liner to cook a
mixture of cheese and meat to eat.  This may sound gross, but when
your life is on the line, you adapt.  Looking back I realize that our
sense of humor was also very gross and vulgar, but it was appropriate
for the conditions.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">The first time we
drew small arms fire we all started shooting at everything in panic. 
Later that night I realized that the only ammunition that I had left
was half a clip of carbine ammunition.  After that I carried
ammunition in all pockets and was very careful in how much I fired
the machine gun or carbine that I carried.  On my birthday in March
we ran into a fanatic group of very young German soldiers who decided
to fight.  We were caught out in the open next to a small river that
we had to wade across to get to a safe place.  I remember worrying
because with all the equipment and ammunition that I was carrying
there was the thought that if I fell, I would drown.  </font>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">In the movies you
always see a machine gunner firing long bursts of ammunition, but it
just isn&rsquo;t so.  First, if you fire a long burst it gives the enemy
time to locate your position and eliminate you.  When all the
ammunition that you have is being carried by the riflemen in your
squad, you have a very limited supply.  </font>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">Just surviving was
work mainly because of the weight that we were carrying.  I carried
the light machine gun that weighed close to 38 pounds, a full canteen
of water, a 30-caliber carbine, lots of carbine ammunition, several
hand grenades, our rations and several layers of clothing.  Most of
the time I would have part of a belt of shells in the machine gun. 
The ammunition for the machine gun came in a cloth belt that had 250
rounds of 30 caliber ammunition in it.  The shells were
armor-piercing, tracer, and solid jacket types.  Tracers were to show
you where your bullets were going.  The fallacy of that was that it
also showed the enemy where you were.  It didn&rsquo;t take long to take
the tracers out of a belt and replace them.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">After we crossed the
Rhine River we would only hit pockets of severe resistance so we
spent much of our time in our half tracks or on the back of a tank,
and didn&rsquo;t dig quite as many foxholes.  When the rains came,
digging a foxhole and sitting in it wasn&rsquo;t fun.  </font>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">An armored division
was divided into three different combat commands.  Two commands
normally did the fighting and one command was in reserve and did the
mopping up.  These combat commands rotated duties and I hated being
in combat command reserve (ccr) after we crossed the Rhine because we
would have to clean up the pockets of young German fanatics.  Usually
these pockets of resistance were in towns or woods and had mostly
very young soldiers fighting in them.  </font>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">A most difficult time
of my army career came at the end of the war at a concentration camp.
 I am the son of a Polish immigrant and am proud of my father&rsquo;s
accomplishments.  I didn&rsquo;t mind letting anyone know that I was an
American first and Polish second. The only problem was that I didn&rsquo;t
learn the Polish language.  The officers in our outfit didn&rsquo;t know
that I couldn&rsquo;t speak Polish, they just knew that I was Polish. 
When the 11</font><sup><font size="4">th</font></sup><font size="4">
Armored Division liberated Mauthausen Concentration Camp, I had been
recruited to help with the Polish prisoners.  </font>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">There is a
misconception that all the prisoners in concentration camps were
Jewish people.  There were extermination camps in Poland and
Czechoslovakia where the Jewish people were sent for extermination. 
Then there were the camps like Mauthausen where political prisoners
and people of influence in the conquered countries were sent to do
work, such as dig an underground petroleum refinery.  These people
usually lived longer but eventually they died of starvation.  </font>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">Much of the memory of
my army career overseas was blocked out of my mind until about 12
years after the war.  This was no doubt due to the shock of seeing so
many bodies.  It was also many years before I realized that I was
selected to help because there were many Polish people at this camp. 
Somebody thought that I could speak Polish.  </font>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">     <font size="4">My father told me
that his mother, my grandmother, had died in some German camp,
probably because she had several sons in the Polish army and one son
in America.  I have always wondered if she were a body at this
concentration camp.  </font>

stands for Automatic Packet Reporting system. It is an excellent way
for your family to keep track of you while your on the road. And useful
for public service events as well.<br />

However their need to be igate's set up in each area you are traveling
through so that your position gets picked up and reported. So it is
very helpful for this software to be setup in a fixed location as well.<br />

What you will need to get started</big><br />



<br />

1. A 2 meter fm radio which can be interfaced to a computer. This could
be as simple &nbsp;as a baofeng HT or as expensive as you want to go. A
radio that has gps built in is a plus but their are work arounds.<br />



2. An interface to the radio, many radios have a usb interface built in
but if not you can use a signal link or it isn't hard to homebrew
&nbsp;an interface<br />

3. A GPS device to allow the software to report your position. it can
be a gps usb dongle a tiny trak device or a radio with built in gps.
Radios with gps built in include the Kenwood D710 and TH-D72a hand held
. If you are setting up a fixed location for an igate or digipeater you
really don't need the gps features. just set your location by hand.<br />



4. Direwolf which is a software TNC for packet radio. I am using version 1.5 as of this writing. Get it at <a href="https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf/releases">https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf/releases</a><br />



5. APRS Software for communication with the radio and the internet..I will show how to setup <a href="http://aprsisce.wikidot.com/">APRSISCE</a><br />



6. If you have an Icom radio such as a 7100&nbsp;etc. that uses a
usb port to interface to your computer you will need one more peice of
software <a href="http://www.cantab.net/users/john.wiseman/Documents/CAT7200.html">CAT7200</a> which allows you to assert ptt to the radio via cat commands<br />



<br />



<br />



<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting up direwolf</span><br />



Download direwolf from the above link and extract it to a folder of your choosing. I put mine in C:\direwolf.<br />
Go to that directory and right &nbsp;click on direwolf.conf and select edit with notepad or your favorite text editor.<br />



In direwolf.conf any line starting with a # is a comment remove the # to make it so it can be read by direwolf.<br />



There are four things we need to add. Look for a line that reads
MYCALL NOCALL remove the pound sign and Change the NOCALL to read as
your callsign use uppercase letters.<br />



<br />



Next make sure the line that says MODEM 1200 is uncommented.I believe
that is the default but make sure. &nbsp;Also KISSPORT should be
uncommented and make note of the port number used. We will need it
for&nbsp; setting up APRSICE in a bit.<br />



<br />



Next find a line that begins ADEVICE usb&nbsp;remove the # and we are going to change the usb to what your sound device is.<br />



For windows 10, &nbsp;If you right click on the voleme icon in your
system tray (looks like a speaker in lower right area of desktop) then
click sounds you will see&nbsp;your sound properties dialog.
click on the playback tab and find the sound device for your interface.
<br />



What that device is named is&nbsp;what we will use. You can actually
change this name if you right click click properties, &nbsp;then type in
a new name in the box. I highly reccomend you do this as many usb
devices will be named usb 1 usb 2 etc. and this gets confusing. I
rename mine to match the name of my radio. &nbsp;Do the same with the
recording device under the recording tab. For earlier windows this same
thing can be done but the programs are accessed a bit differently.<br />



Back to direwolf.conf edit the ADEVICE line to match your sound device
names. Here is what mine looks like &nbsp;ADEVICE 7100 out 7100 in
&nbsp;I named my playback device for the ic-7100 radio &nbsp;7100 out
and the recording device 7100 in. You will need two devices listed
on theis line, one is for playback device and one is for recording
device. It is acceptable to name them the same thing.<br />



<br />



Next find the line that says PTT COM1 RTS and remove the #. Change com1
to the com port you use to assert PTT on your radio. If you go to
device manager and click on ports you can find what comports you have.
You may have more than one but you need to determine which one is your
interface port for the radio. &nbsp; For the icom usb radios see the
CAT7200 section below. A signal link device uses VOX so you won't need
to setup a PTT port for them.&nbsp; <br />



That should finish up Direwolf setup. Be sure to save your file and try
running direwolf. Green lines are good and red lines are bad so if
nothing is red you should be fine. Iif not the program should give
you a good idea as to what is wrong.<br />



<br />



<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting up APRSISCE</span><br />

First you will need an aprs passcode. You can send an email to
aprsisce-owner@yahoogroups.com&nbsp; and he will email you a password..
If you already have a passcode but have forgotten what it is google
aprs passcode to find a way to find yours. It is pretty simple. <br />



install <a href="http://aprsisce.wikidot.com/">APRSSISCE</a> and
run it. &nbsp;You need to put in your call sign and passcode then save
before it will run. Next drag the cursor on the map and zoom in to set
your home location. Right click and select center on me. Next on the
menu click on configure &gt;&gt; ports and click new port.<br />

For type set to "simply KISS" and for name call it direwolf. Click create
and from the next menu select TCP/IP. Set IP or DNS to 127.0.0.1
and set the port to the port you setup for direwolf. In my case
that is 8001. Click Accept and now ARPSISCE should be configured to use
direwolf to communicate with your radio. <br />

In a fixed location you can be setup as either an igate or a
digipeater. Igates just monitor signals and forward to the internet
aprs gateway. Digiopeaters can rebroadcast packets heard. If you decide
to do this to avoid cluttering the frequency needlessly you can setup
the number of hops to be digipeated. See this&nbsp;website for
digipeating. <a href="http://aprsisce.wikidot.com/doc:digipeating">http://aprsisce.wikidot.com/doc:digipeating</a> . For an igate
</big><span style="color: rgb(10, 10, 10); font-family: -apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Roboto,Oxygen,Ubuntu,Cantarell,&quot;Fira Sans&quot;,&quot;Droid Sans&quot;,&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: rgb(254, 254, 254); display: inline ! important; float: none;">You
have some choices to make at this point. Go back to configure and
select the direwolf port. Do you want your IGate to receive packets
only or do you want to make it capable of sending in addition to
receiving? If the former, your IGate will not show up on the RF side.
However, it will show up on the IS side and will, more importantly,
pass packets over to the IS side when they are received. If
that&rsquo;s what you want, select RF to IS, Enabled, Bulletin/Obj, and
Messages. All the other defaults are fine. If you want the latter, your
IGate will make its presence known periodically via RF. More
importantly, if someone tries to text a mobile user that&rsquo;s within
your range but not within originator&rsquo;s range, your IGate will
relay the message to the user. For this scenario, select IS to RF, Xmit
Enable, and Beacon, in addition to the options listed above.</span> Enjoy<br />

<br />



<span style="font-weight: bold;">setting up CAT7200 for those with&nbsp;newer icom radios<br />



<br />



</span>The newer icom radios use a usb port to provide cat control and
sound in and out for computer control. The problem is programs like
direwolf and sound modem do not use cat commands. Instead they just use a
simple com port to asset PTT. Icom doesnt provide this but someone was
nice enough to write a program to do this. It is called CAT7200 and
includes a driver for a virtual comport that you can use with Direwolf
to assert PTT.<br />



Download CAT 7200 here<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></big><big> <a href="http://www.cantab.net/users/john.wiseman/Documents/CAT7200.html">CAT7200</a></big><big>&nbsp;Once
you have it extract to a folder maybe c:\CAT7200 &nbsp;There are to
subfolders one for 32bit windows and one for 64bit windows. &nbsp;<br />



For windows 10 open device manager. Click on the computer icon at top
of list. Click action at top of window and click add legacy
hardware.&nbsp; &nbsp;Click next, pick install the hardware that i
manually select from a list, click next twice. From the list of devices
find and select Ports (com &amp; lpt) click next. Select standard pot
types and communications port and click have disk. &nbsp;navigate to
the CAT7200 folder and to the proper sub folder either vcom32 for 32bit
or vcom64 64bit and select the file and install. the port. you will
need to reboot your computer to finish. &nbsp;If windows complains
about it being an unsigned driver and refuses to install there is a
work around for that. See <a href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/install-unsigned-drivers-windows10/">this page</a>.
&nbsp;Once you have your computer reinstalled look in device manager
again to see what port the virtual port got assigned to. If you want to,
you can change this port number by right clicking on the port. Clicking
properties, go to &nbsp;port settings then click advanced and pick a
different port from the&nbsp;drop down list.<br />



Run CAT7200 and select your new virtual com port for application port.
then for cat port this is the port the radio supplies via usb. for me
it is com4 but you will need to &nbsp;find the right one. when you get
the port number entered enter the speed tou use then there is a civ
address box below this needs to be set to rthe civ address of your
radio. for an icom 7100 it is 88 for a 9100 it's 7C but look in your
manual or radios menus and find what yours is set to.<br />
Click on open and click test. If it is setup right, your radio should go
into ptt mode. Click test again to stiop transmitting. Now edit
direwolf.conf and define the PTT port to your new virtual com port.
&nbsp;To use APRSISCE you will first need to run cat 7200 and open the
port. Leave it running, run direwolf then run APRSISCE<br />



Enjoy APRS!<br />

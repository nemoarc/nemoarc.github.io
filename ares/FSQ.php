Since we all share a common <br>frequency and the protocol prevents collisions with signals that it can HEAR the low <br>power signal that is just "not quite strong enough" may well be transmitted on top of.<br><br>The power thing has been a big deal on PSK31 mainly because most people run their <br>receivers in the SSB bandwidth rather than a more appropriate 100 Hz. bandwidth. It is <br>true that a very strong signal within this SSB bandwidth will cause the receiver's <br>AGC to reduce the receiver gain as well as the similar actions within the sound card. <br><br>People perceive and condemn the power but the problem is usually within the receiver's <br>bandwidth and AGC settings.<br><br>This problem does not exist with FSQ, as currently implemented, as we are on the <br>same frequency, use narrow receiver bandwidths and/or narrow demodulator (fledge for <br>example) bandwidths. If you can hear the other signal you will not transmit on top <br>of it. If you can't hear it you probably will.<br><br>FSQ is not a low power mode, it is not very robust under weak, poor conditions. <br>You will sometimes need 100 watts to complete a contact or use lower power and <br>utilization of a relay station via the relay commands. That said, most of the <br>time...I do OK on 30m with 50 watts.<br><br>I changed my QTC message to provide info on my station, i.e. power out <br>and antenna. So others can query my QTH and QTC to check my station. I have <br>never called CQ in this FSQ mode. Rather just asked if any one is listening since <br>this is more like a party line. Still if using FSQCALL you have a separate CQ button.<br><br>On mine, I put "n5pvl monitoring" in QTC. Something that I can manually activate when I'm <br>in the shack, the frequency is clear, and I am ready to chat. - It lets everybody who can <br>hear, and is interested know that I am ready to chat. As FSQ is really a chat mode, as <br>opposed to being a formal QSO mode, I really see no point in calling CQ.<br><br>The QTC button is to the left of the QTH button. I edited mine to just indicate "listening" as <br>opposed to calling "CQ". I edited my QTH to include my name and then I set a text <br>file for station rundown.<br><br>Essentially there are two modes:<br><br>(1) The simpler, default mode (suits beginners), where every station <br>that transmits will appear on the main receive screen, whether they are <br>in Directed mode or not. No checksums are sent. This is the 'chat' mode.<br><br>(2) The Directed mode is the one which has the checksums. When YOUR <br>station is in Directed mode, your main screen will ONLY show messages <br>directed specifically to your call sign (or to 'allcall'). Messages with <br>incorrect syntax or sent in chat mode do NOT show, although you can keep <br>an eye on them in the Monitor tab of the Options Pane.<br><br>Further, the many selective commands provided in FSQ ONLY work when the <br>transmitting station and intended recipient are BOTH in Directed <br>(FSQCall) mode.<br><br>You've no easy way of knowing whether a CRC is valid or not, but the <br>program will work it out. For the message to show on your main receive <br>screen (not the Monitor) in Directed mode, it must:<br><br>(a) Have been sent in Directed mode (have a CRC).<br>(b) Be directed to your callsign (remember it's case sensitive), or to 'allcall'.<br>(c) Have a valid checksum matching the callsign.<br>(d) Have a valid trigger sent immediately after the checksum.<br><br>Other messages that meet only requirements (a) and (c) will still be <br>logged and appear in the Heard List. Stations in chat mode are not <br>logged because there is no way to verify the call sign.<br><br>Note that I am describing how I operate, and why. I do not require other stations to <br>operate the same way that I do. - How one operates is the responsibility of individual <br>hams to determine for themselves.<br><br><br>

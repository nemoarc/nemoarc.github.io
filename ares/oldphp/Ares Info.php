<br>
There are 5 PDF files here which you the operator/coordinator will find
interesting. <br>
<br>
First is the <a href="ARESFieldResourcesManual.pdf">ARRL
Field Resource Manual</a>, which will aid you in getting ready
and <br>deploying to a scene for emergency operations. This scene will most likely be in <br>your town or
general area, unless you opt for deploying to another region to assist <br>their on going emergency.<br>
<br>
Next ARRL manual to read would be the <a href="ARESmanual2015.pdf">Amateur
Radio Emergency Service</a> manual. <br>
Chock full of good information and well worth the time to get an
overall feel for the <br>ARES service that we provide.<br>
<br>
An older version of the <a href="ARES%20Manual.pdf">ARES
Manual</a> is here, but the one above is newer.<br>
